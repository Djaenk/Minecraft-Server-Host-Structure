# Minecraft-Server-Host-Structure
This repo houses the rudimentary scripts and directory structure I used to manage my Minecraft server.

### Usage
Create a subdirectory in the `Servers` directory for each Minecraft server to be hosted. Edit the bottom of the relevant shell scrips in the `scripts` directory to call the relevant function on the created subdirectory. I would recommend setting up cron jobs to call the scripts periodically.

### Bugs
Should problems arise, feel free to submit an issue. Just don't expect a hasty response, as I don't keep a close eye on this repo.
